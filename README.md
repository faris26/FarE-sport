For this project all the tabs are not functional, if we had to spend more time on it, I think we should make the  "RequÃªte" tab not be displayed for visitors but only for administrators with the statistics that allow to get out. Also make some tabs or buttons functional, for example only the map "Lyon esport 2021" is functional because it allowed to understand how the site works. It would only be necessary to duplicate our work to all the cards.

Feedback is highly appreciated, thank you!
